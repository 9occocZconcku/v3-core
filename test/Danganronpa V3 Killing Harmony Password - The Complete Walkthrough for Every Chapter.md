One of the mysteries that you will encounter in the game is the password for Rantaro's vault, which is located in his Ultimate Survivor Lab. Rantaro was the first victim of the killing game, and his vault contains important clues about his identity and the truth behind the game.
 
To find the password for Rantaro's vault, you will need to pay attention to the clues that are scattered throughout the game. Here are some of the steps that you can follow to unlock the vault:
 
- In Chapter 2, you will find a hidden door in the library that leads to a secret passageway. Inside, you will see a monitor that shows Rantaro's last moments before he was killed by the mastermind. You will also see a shot put ball rolling down a vent and hitting Rantaro on the head.
- In Chapter 4, you will discover that the shot put ball was actually part of a trap set by Kaede, who was trying to stop the mastermind from killing someone. However, she was unaware that someone else had tampered with her trap and made it hit Rantaro instead.
- In Chapter 5, you will learn that Tsumugi was the one who modified Kaede's trap and killed Rantaro. She also reveals that she is the mastermind behind the killing game and that she is a cosplayer who can impersonate anyone. She also claims that she is part of a group called Team Danganronpa, who are responsible for creating and broadcasting the killing game as a reality show.
- In Chapter 6, you will find out that Rantaro was actually a survivor of a previous killing game and that he had a special perk called Survivor Perk Monopad. This device contained information about his role and his mission in the current killing game. However, he never got to use it because Tsumugi stole it from him before he died.
- In order to access Rantaro's vault, you will need to use his Survivor Perk Monopad as the key. The password for the vault is actually hidden in the device's name. If you look closely, you will notice that there are six letters in bold: S U R V I B E. These letters are an anagram for the password: VIBERS.

Once you enter VIBERS as the password, you will be able to open Rantaro's vault and see what's inside. You will find a video message from Rantaro himself, explaining his role as the Ultimate Survivor and his mission to stop the mastermind. He also reveals that he has another hidden Monopad that contains more details about his past and the truth behind Team Danganronpa.
 
However, before you can watch the video, Tsumugi interrupts you and tries to stop you from learning more. She also reveals that she has planted bombs all over the school and threatens to blow everything up if you don't give up on finding out the truth.
 
Will you be able to escape from Tsumugi's trap and uncover the secrets of Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony? Find out by playing this thrilling game on PC or PlayStation 4 today!
